When setting up a new grid you need to edit these files:

cime_config/config_grids.xml
components/eam/bld/config_files/horiz_grid.xml
components/eam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_eam.xml
components/elm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml

and maybe these:

components/eam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
